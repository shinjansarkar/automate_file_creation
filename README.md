## Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

To isolate your project and avoid dependency conflicts, create a virtual environment:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   
Activate the Virtual Environment

 On Windows:
 ```bash
